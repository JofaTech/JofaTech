# Hey Everyone! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">
My name is Brandon Lukevich, a Computer Science graduate from the University of Florida, and I am actively seeking a role as a software engineer or developer. I enjoy tackling problems outside of my wheelhouse, as there is nothing more satisfying than successfully breaking down and solving a complex problem (and learning something along the way). PLease reach out so we can chat!
